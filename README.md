# Cyber Security Framework
This framework is based on the [NIST Cyber Security Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). It has been combined with the [CIS 20 Critical Controls] (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) in order to have checks.

The goal is **not** to have the ultimate cyber security framework that covers everything. If you know something better, use the better framework.
